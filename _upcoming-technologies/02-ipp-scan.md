title: IPP scan (or virtual MF device) server (Scanner Application)
---
IPPScan is an extension of the existing IPP protocol to facilitate driverless scanning. Currently, to scan in linux, a user has to procure the device specific SANE driver and then use a command line or a GUI based application that communicates with that scanner using this driver. An IPPScan enabled scanner would be able to communicate and transfer standard files (pdf/jpeg) with a daemon running on the client, thus eliminating the need of scanner specific drivers. However, currently there are no such scanners enabled in the market. This application attempts to remedy this situation by emulating IPPScan versions of ordinary scanners. This is beneficial as we move all the drivers to the central scan service rather than keeping a copy of each driver on each client and this also enables the sandboxed packaging of scanner drivers. The added benefits of a central service also include authentication and effective administration of scanners in a large enterprise setting.
